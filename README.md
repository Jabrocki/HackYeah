#### for the development purposes

Flutter project that our team developed during HackYeah 2024.
MonteCarlo tracks users fitness statistics like "cycled kilometers, pushups, hours spent working out".
Another feature is timer that informs user to take a break from working too long.

In development:
 - LeaderBoard: simple board where users can see who is the most active. Leaderboard is based on the point system.
 - Rival system: competetive "game". On home page, user will see his closest rival in any of the available activity - when he eventually overtakes his rival, he will recieve bonus leaderboard points.
 - SocialBoard: users can post their progress on the social board - users can like posts and reward the author of the post with points.
